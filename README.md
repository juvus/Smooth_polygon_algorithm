# Smooth polygon algorithm
## Description
The application demonstates the work of the algorithm for constructing an arbitrary polygon with smoothed vertices. Determination of the points needed to smooth vertices is based on utilizing the de Casteljan algorithm. 

When tha application is started, two graphic windows are opened: *drawing window* which render a smooth polygon and *control window* which determines settings for the generation of a new polygon. These windows are shown on Fig. 1.
